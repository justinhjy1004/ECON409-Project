Data Analysis and Visualization of the Gig Economy

The emergence of community-based online platforms that facilitates peer-to-peer based economic activity such as Uber, Lyft and Airbnb has significantly changed and disrupted local economies and their respective industries. We are interested in the effects of the introduction of the “sharing economy”, specifically Airbnb and Uber. 

Airbnb - It is a common criticism that Airbnb causes home prices to rise as a result of increase demand of housing for homestays and tourists lodging that could otherwise be rented out. To assess the legitimacy of such arguments, we have to obtain information about multi-panel data of house prices and also airbnb listings in an area to understand its effects. Furthermore, some cities, such as New York City, enacted strict policies that restricted Airbnb, which could be a perfect natural experiment to determine causality. 

Ride-Hailing Apps (Uber & Lyft) - The growing popularity of ride-hailing apps has been a disruptive force in cities across the world. Its introduction and its effect on taxi services, the main competitor, has led to an array of regulations and bans of the service. We will gather historical data on traffic in US cities, explore the presence of alcohol in traffic fatalities, and compare the technology’s respective introduction with the employment and performance of taxi companies.
